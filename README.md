## Welcome to OpenTA: The Future of Online Learning

Imagine a world where every online learner gets a personal, AI-powered teaching assistant as if they were attending university in-person. **Welcome to OpenTA**: the future of online courseware.

Currently, over **380 million students worldwide** rely on online courses from massive open online courses (MOOCs) such as Coursera, Udemy, and Stanford Digital Education. However, these MOOCs and their courses suffer from **lackluster course retention rates (<5%)**. This subpar performance is attributed to the impersonal nature of online learning, where students miss out on dynamic discussions, immediate feedback, and the enriching activities that spark curiosity and deepen understanding.

## Introducing OpenTA

We designed OpenTA as a **web app platform** that bridges the gap between online learners and their courses. OpenTA leverages cutting-edge generative AI to offer a suite of solutions:

- **Engaging Discussions**
- **Tailored Quizzes/Exams**
- **Concise Notes**
- **Insightful Summaries**
- **24/7 Q&A**

...all instantaneously customized for each course. Our platform features individual dashboard management across multiple organizations and for numerous courses. In each separate course, OpenTA is specially trained and knowledgeable in its respective subject, and because of its specialization, it is able to answer course-specific questions and curate active recall practice quizzes pertaining to lecture material.

## Our Goal

The goal of OpenTA is to provide an engaging platform for online students to intimately connect with their course content and remain committed to their learning journey. OpenTA is here to **redefine what it means to learn online**, making education accessible, personal, and infinitely more engaging for everyone, everywhere.

Get ready to experience online learning **like never before.**
